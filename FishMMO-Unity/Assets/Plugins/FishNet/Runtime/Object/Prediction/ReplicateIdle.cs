    /* FISHMMO EDIT: held idle input (opt-in).
     *
     * An owner standing still produces the same input every tick. Without this, every one of those ticks is sent (the input
     * is not "default", since it carries an aim and a has-data marker), which for an idle player is most of its upload, and
     * the server needs every one of them because an empty queue runs DEFAULT data, which a game cannot treat as "the same as
     * before".
     *
     * With a type opted in, an input that repeats the previous one and may be held (CanHold) does not restart the owner's
     * resend countdown, so after the usual redundant resends the owner stops sending, apart from a keepalive. The server,
     * finding the queue empty after such an input, runs that input again on each tick (HELD), numbered on from the last one,
     * exactly what the owner is running. When real input resumes, the held ticks are lined up by number with what arrives
     * (ReplicateHoldPlanner): identical repeats are dropped, the first different input runs on its own tick, and a late one
     * runs at once. Nothing the owner sent is ever discarded unless it is identical to what the server already ran. */
